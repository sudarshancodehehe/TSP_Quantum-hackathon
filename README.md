Classical vs Quantum Comparison

This project evaluates classical and quantum approaches to computational problems using the following methods:

Mathematical Formulation: Classical and quantum algorithms are analyzed by breaking down their mathematical structures and comparing computational complexity.

Circuit Implementations: Equivalent operations are implemented both as classical functions and quantum circuits, demonstrating differences in efficiency.

Execution and Benchmarking: By running both classical and quantum models on simulated environments, execution times and resource usage are recorded.

Visualization: Quantum states and classical outputs are plotted to provide an intuitive comparison of results.

Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA): The project specifically applies QAOA to solve optimization problems. The classical approach relies on brute force and heuristic methods, whereas QAOA leverages quantum superposition and interference to provide near-optimal solutions efficiently. The effectiveness of QAOA is assessed by comparing the quality of solutions and execution times against classical algorithms.
